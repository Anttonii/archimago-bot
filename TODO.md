## DONE!

- \[x\] Replace cimg with a command that can be inserted anywhere in a message with format: \[!name of the card here\]
  - This functionality was not replaced but the additional feature was added.
- \[x\] Change the activity randomly from a set of possible activities
- \[x\] Make the bot track editing messages so that editing an improper command in a message results in a new message that evaluates the edited command
- Bot now edits messages if the message replied is edited.

## TODO

- \[ \] Cache images to disk.
- \[ \] When caching images, rotate sites by 90 degrees.
- \[ \] Add set parameterization to retrieving cards and images
