## DONE!

- \[x\] Replace cimg with a command that can be inserted anywhere in a message with format: \[!name of the card here\]
  - This functionality was not replaced but the additional feature was added.
- \[x\] Change the activity randomly from a set of possible activities

  - Bot now edits messages if the message replied is edited.
- \[x\] Add term explanations from the official rulebook
- \[x\] Add command for retrieving the rulebook
- \[x\] Add back the help command

## TODO

## In consideration

- \[ \] Pool requests made to the bot to stop the bot from getting blocked
